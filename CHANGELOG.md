# Changelog

## 1.0.4 - 2026-10-25
- Fixes the C-stick not working in a game while the plugin is in its folder (issue #1, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate; also seen in Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate). On a New 3DS the plugin framework opened the `ir:rst` service (C-stick, ZL, ZR), which has only two sessions. The plugin no longer opens it.
- ZL and ZR can no longer be part of the in-game menu key combination (they cannot be read any more).
- The in-game menu is now off by default (`menu_key=off`); an existing ini keeps its value, and the app's *In-game menu* switch puts `L+R+Select` back.
- Tested: Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate in a two-console room, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate in single player.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-10-23
First public release.
